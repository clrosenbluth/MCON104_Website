    <h2>Welcome to Your School</h2>
    <p>School By You is the shared result of a group of
        parents and educators with one simple goal: to
        give our children the best educational experience
        they can have. We wanted our children to have an
        education which gave them the tools they needed,
        in the way they needed. And that's what we want
        for your children, too.
    </p>
