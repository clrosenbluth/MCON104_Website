    <h2>Who We Are</h2>

    <section id="philosophy">
        <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>

        <p>
            We believe that all children are unique and have something
            special that they can bring to the world. We want to
            assist them in actualizing their potential by giving
            them an education that fits their needs and plays to
            their strengths. We believe that the final say in education
            should lie with the parents, who understands what their
            child needs.

        <h3>Our History</h3>

        <p>
            The first School By You was built (metaphorically!)
            by a group of parents who wanted an alternative to
            local schooling options. Five sets of parents reached
            out to a few local teachers, options were discussed -
            and a movement was born! We told our friends, they told
            their friends, more teachers started getting involved,
            and our website finally went live in 2012.
        </p>

        <p>
            Today, School By You is assisting with the educations
            of hundreds of thousands of children, and we're still
            going strong.
